# Dribbble Challenge-1
This project is done as a part of the Le-Wagon Coding Bootcamp. In order to better understand how GitHub works; I started this as a new GitHub project and didn't continue as a part of Fullstack-Challenges.

I am planning to copy three different Dribbble websites. As first project, I chose this: https://dribbble.com/shots/4960076-Pricing-Plan

## The problems I couldn't solve (yet):
I need to study grids more! The children element were overflowing and I couldn't solve it. I ended up styling for each device.
