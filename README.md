# Dribbble Challenge-1
For this project, I got the inspiration from the CopyCat (Open Component) Challenge of Le-Wagon Coding Bootcamp. In order to better understand how GitHub works; I started this as a new GitHub project and didn't continue as a part of Fullstack-Challenges. I created and coded all HTML CSS and JS folders/files from scratch.

I am planning to copy three different Dribbble websites. As first project, I chose this: https://dribbble.com/shots/4960076-Pricing-Plan

## The problems I couldn't solve (yet):
* I need to study grids more! The child elements were overflowing and I couldn't solve it. I ended up styling (poorly) for each device. I first used flexbox instead of grids, but I had the same overflowing problem. 

* I had problems with GitHub showing my page, since my index.html was inside a folder. I used a dummy index.html redirecting to the original one, but that didn't work. In the end I created a new gh-pages branch and renamed the folder to docs and got it working.
