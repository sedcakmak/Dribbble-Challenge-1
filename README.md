# Dribbble Challenge-1
For this project, I got the inspiration from the CopyCat (Open Component) Challenge of Le-Wagon Coding Bootcamp. In order to better understand how GitHub works; I started this as a new GitHub project and didn't continue as a part of Fullstack-Challenges. I created and coded all HTML CSS and JS folders/files from scratch.

I am planning to copy three different Dribbble websites. As first project, I chose this: https://dribbble.com/shots/4960076-Pricing-Plan
